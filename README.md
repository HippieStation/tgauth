# tgauth
Source files for /tg/Station 13's various auth components

These are bare files hardcoded to work with /tg/ website, byond codebase, and url. They will not work out of the box on another site and will require modification or massive rewrites.

The hope is to give any of our forks attempting to build a robust web framework a robust starting point.

This system is designed to work with tgdb and phpbb and will even make assumptions about where they are on the file system.
